\f0\fs24 \cf0 Cell phones are dependent on cellular signal to perform their designed tasks (texting and calling) in \
addition to their added functions (web access, games, music/video streaming, etc).\
However, outside of a signal strength bar, users know very little about the cellular signal they are\
getting and using. Tower Power is designed to retrieve all local cell towers and their associated\
signal statistics regardless of their affiliation and display them for the user to see. This\
information can be used to help the user identify why their service is so good/bad and can be\
used to help them make decisions regarding their cellular provider.}
